        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          The International Society for Universal Dialogue, or ISUD for short, is a society for the
          betterment of our world.

          <h3>Who are we?</h3>
          <p>
            We are a society mainly composed of scholars and philosophers
            from all over the world. We are devoted to promoting international dialogue, fostering
            discussions relating to fundamental questions of universal concern. Questions whose
            answers affect all humanity.
          </p>

          <h3>What do we ask?</h3>
          <p>
            As we push international dialogue forward with fundamental questions, we could
            not do so without said questions.
          </p>
          <ul class="questions">
            <li>What role does Philosophical thinking have to play in moving forward
            toward a more rational and more human future?</li>
            <li>What are ethical principles of dialogue?</li>
            <li>How may one understand cultural diversity and universality?</li>
            <li>How best to work toward a culture of peace?</li>
            <li>What is the relationship between the basic liberties of individuals and the
            collective rights of cultural groups?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These are just some questions we ask not only ourselves, but the world at large. We
            believe that by following these questions to their rational answers and conclusions
            we will be able to push for a betterment of our entire international community as one.
